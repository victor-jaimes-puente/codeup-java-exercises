//        Create a do-while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.
//        Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.
//        Create a do-while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 1,000,000. Output should equal:

        int i = 5;
        do {

            System.out.print(" " + i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 15);
    }
